# Day 25 - Milestone: File I/O Deep Dive (Python ‚Üí Java Data Persistence)

## üêç ‚û°Ô∏è ‚òï Python to Java Transition

**Quarter Milestone!** You've completed 25 days of Java mastery. Now let's master comprehensive file operations and data persistence!

## üéØ Learning Objectives
- Master advanced file I/O operations and NIO.2 API
- Learn comprehensive data serialization techniques
- Practice working with multiple file formats (JSON, XML, CSV, Binary)
- Understand enterprise data persistence strategies
- Compare Java's robust I/O with Python's simplicity

## üìñ Theory - Python vs Java File Operations

### üêç Python File I/O (What You Know)
```python
import json
import csv
import pickle

# Simple file operations
with open("data.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()

# JSON handling
with open("config.json", "w") as file:
    json.dump(data, file, indent=2)

# CSV processing
with open("data.csv", "w", newline="") as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerows(data)

# Object serialization
with open("objects.pkl", "wb") as file:
    pickle.dump(my_objects, file)
```

### ‚òï Java File I/O (What You're Learning)
```java
import java.nio.file.*;
import java.io.*;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;

public class FileManager {
    // Modern NIO.2 approach
    public String readFile(String filename) throws IOException {
        Path path = Paths.get(filename);
        return Files.readString(path, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
    }
    
    // JSON with Jackson
    public void saveAsJson(Object data, String filename) throws IOException {
        ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
        mapper.writerWithDefaultPrettyPrinter()
              .writeValue(new File(filename), data);
    }
    
    // Object serialization
    public void saveObject(Serializable obj, String filename) throws IOException {
        try (ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(
                new FileOutputStream(filename))) {
            oos.writeObject(obj);
        }
    }
}
```

## üöÄ Project: Enterprise File Management System

Create a comprehensive file management system with advanced I/O operations and data persistence!

**Key Java Concepts:**
- NIO.2 API with Path and Files classes
- Object serialization and custom serialization
- JSON/XML processing with Jackson and JAXB
- Stream-based I/O for large files
- File watching and monitoring systems

**Features to Build:**
- Multi-format file browser and manager
- Advanced data import/export with validation
- Real-time file monitoring and synchronization
- Backup and restore with compression
- Configuration management and templating

**Challenges:**
1. **Basic File Operations** - Core I/O with NIO.2 and stream processing
2. **Data Serialization** - JSON, XML, binary, and custom formats
3. **Advanced Features** - File monitoring, compression, and encryption
4. **Enterprise System** - Configuration management and data migration
