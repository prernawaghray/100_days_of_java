# Day 16 - Coffee Machine OOP (Python ‚Üí Java Inheritance & Polymorphism)

## üêç ‚û°Ô∏è ‚òï Python to Java Transition

**Building on Day 15:** You've mastered OOP fundamentals. Now let's explore inheritance, polymorphism, and advanced object-oriented design patterns!

## üéØ Learning Objectives
- Master inheritance and class hierarchies
- Learn polymorphism and method overriding
- Practice abstract classes and interfaces
- Understand the super keyword and constructor chaining
- Compare Java's explicit inheritance with Python's flexible approach

## üìñ Theory - Python vs Java Inheritance

### üêç Python Inheritance (What You Know)
```python
class CoffeeMachine:
    def __init__(self, water=1000, coffee=500):
        self.water = water
        self.coffee = coffee
    
    def make_coffee(self):
        return "Basic coffee made"

class EspressoMachine(CoffeeMachine):
    def __init__(self, water=1000, coffee=500, pressure=9):
        super().__init__(water, coffee)
        self.pressure = pressure
    
    def make_coffee(self):  # Override
        return f"Espresso made at {self.pressure} bars"
```

### ‚òï Java Inheritance (What You're Learning)
```java
// Base class
public abstract class CoffeeMachine {
    protected int water;
    protected int coffee;
    
    public CoffeeMachine(int water, int coffee) {
        this.water = water;
        this.coffee = coffee;
    }
    
    // Abstract method - must be implemented by subclasses
    public abstract String makeCoffee();
}

// Inheritance with extends keyword
public class EspressoMachine extends CoffeeMachine {
    protected int pressure;
    
    public EspressoMachine(int water, int coffee, int pressure) {
        super(water, coffee); // Call parent constructor
        this.pressure = pressure;
    }
    
    @Override // Annotation for method overriding
    public String makeCoffee() {
        return String.format("Espresso made at %d bars", pressure);
    }
}
```

## üöÄ Project: Advanced Coffee Shop Management System

Create a comprehensive coffee shop system with multiple machine types, inheritance hierarchies, and polymorphic behavior!

**Key Java Concepts:**
- Abstract classes and inheritance hierarchies
- Method overriding with @Override annotation
- Polymorphism and dynamic method dispatch
- Interface implementation for common behaviors
- Constructor chaining with super keyword

**Features to Build:**
- Multiple machine types with specialized capabilities
- Polymorphic collections and method calls
- Interface-based design for payment processing
- Factory pattern for creating different machines
- Comprehensive shop management system

**Challenges:**
1. **Basic Inheritance** - Create CoffeeMachine hierarchy with specialized types
2. **Polymorphic Behavior** - Implement interfaces and polymorphic collections
3. **Advanced Patterns** - Add factory pattern and complex interactions
4. **Complete System** - Build full coffee shop management with analytics
