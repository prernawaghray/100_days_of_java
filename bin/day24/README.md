# Day 24 - Space Invaders (Python ‚Üí Java Sound & Advanced Graphics)

## üêç ‚û°Ô∏è ‚òï Python to Java Transition

**Building on Day 23:** You've mastered AI and pathfinding. Now let's explore sound integration and advanced graphics effects!

## üéØ Learning Objectives
- Learn Java Sound API for audio integration
- Master advanced graphics effects and shaders
- Practice sprite animation and particle systems
- Understand performance optimization for graphics
- Compare Java's comprehensive audio/graphics with Python's libraries

## üìñ Theory - Python vs Java Audio/Graphics

### üêç Python Audio/Graphics (What You Know)
```python
import pygame
import pygame.mixer

# Simple sound loading and playing
pygame.mixer.init()
shoot_sound = pygame.mixer.Sound("shoot.wav")
shoot_sound.play()

# Basic sprite animation
for frame in sprite_frames:
    screen.blit(frame, (x, y))
    pygame.display.flip()
```

### ‚òï Java Audio/Graphics (What You're Learning)
```java
import javax.sound.sampled.*;
import java.awt.image.BufferedImage;

public class SoundManager {
    private Map<String, Clip> soundClips = new HashMap<>();
    
    public void loadSound(String name, String filename) throws Exception {
        AudioInputStream audioStream = AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream(
            new File(filename));
        Clip clip = AudioSystem.getClip();
        clip.open(audioStream);
        soundClips.put(name, clip);
    }
    
    public void playSound(String name) {
        Clip clip = soundClips.get(name);
        if (clip != null) {
            clip.setFramePosition(0);
            clip.start();
        }
    }
}
```
