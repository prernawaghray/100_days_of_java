# Day 19 - Snake Game (Python → Java Game Development)

## 🐍 ➡️ ☕ Python to Java Transition

**Building on Day 18:** You've mastered graphics and animation. Now let's create a complete game with collision detection, game states, and user input!

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Learn game loop architecture and timing
- Master collision detection algorithms
- Practice keyboard input handling
- Understand game state management
- Compare Java's structured game development with Python's simplicity

## 🚀 Project: Advanced Snake Game Suite
Create a comprehensive snake game with multiple modes, power-ups, and advanced features!

**Key Java Concepts:**
- Timer class for precise game loop timing
- KeyListener for keyboard input handling
- Graphics2D for advanced rendering and effects
- Enum types for game state management
- Collections for dynamic game object lists

**Features to Build:**
- Multiple Game Modes (Classic, speed, maze, multiplayer variants)
- Advanced Graphics (Smooth animations, particle effects, themes)
- Power-up System (Temporary abilities and special items)
- Collision Detection (Precise hit detection for all game objects)
- Persistent Data (High scores, statistics, unlockable content)
